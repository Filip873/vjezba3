<h3>Moje najdraze pjesma</h3>

<p><b>Even Flow</b></p>

<p>
Freezin' rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again ooh yeah <br>
Oh feelin' maybe he'll see a little betters any days ooh yeah <br>
Oh hand out faces that he sees come again ain't that familiar <br>
Oh dark grin he can't help when he's happy he looks insane <br>
Even flow <br>
Thoughts arrive like butterflies <br>
Oh he don't know, so he chases them away <br>
Someday yet he'll begin his life again <br>
Life again, life again <br>
Kneelin' looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh yeah <br>
Oh, prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything <br>
Oh, feelin', understands the weather or that winters on its way <br>
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame, yeah <br>
Even flow <br>
Thoughts arrive like butterflies <br>
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away <br>
Someday yet he'll begin his life again <br>
Oh whispering hands, gently lead him away <br>
